## Usage and testing

To run the development server:

```bash
npm i
# then
npm run dev
```

Open the link provided by Vite in your console

## Technical choices I made

(Appart from React / TS / Tailwind)

- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev) - To bundle everything together and manage the dev server (+ SVGs)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev) - To handle form validation
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - To handle navigation between pages

### Choices that were tempting

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) - I just love it !
- [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com) - To manage the Themes form, but it seemed overkill


## Points to mention or improve

- I spent arround 4-5h on the test and couldn't treat everything, especially the carousel of cards. I would've helped myself with [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@skaswathisk/multi-card-carousel-without-external-libraries-in-react-typescript-js-7834cb3d087f) (adding some blurry effects) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YnryDjEGr8) (adapting the sizes and effects) to build it. To handle this development confortably, I think that I would've like to spend 2 to 3 days on it (full time !)

- I used no IA of any sort. No Copilot, no ChatGPT. What I've done isn't much, it's indeed classic React features, but I have them in head at least !

- It was really cool to work on such a nice looking design and a rich Figma like this. I'm not used to it, I usually make the Figma myself and it's... Well... Less nice in the end.

- I realize when writting this at the very end that I forgot to add the character at the bottom right of the Themes form. Sorry !
